## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ It's me, Marina!

I'm a software engineer who started my career as a tester, so imagine the kind of developer I am! :monocle_face:	
As a software engineer, I implement new features and fix bugs in a critical, complex and distributed Air Traffic Management system.
Beyond development, I lead and actively participate in groommming meetings to discuss architecture, security and high-performance solutions
for the new feateures. I'm also involved in code reviews and regularly helping the juniors developers in their tasks. 
Following good development practices such as SOLID, clean code and Design Patterns are part of my daily routine. 
I'm also responsible for analyzing every single Pull Request our squad sends to the main branch.

Over the past 7+ years I've being working in a complex and extremely critical project within a cross-functional team.

I'm well known by my colleges for my eagerness to learn, boldness in taking on challenging tasks and strong
communication skills.
